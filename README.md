# Kotlin Sprite Kit

This is a kotlin library designed to make 2d animated games. 

It is a work in progress primarily just being done for fun and learning.

It makes use of Java canvas to draw sprites using sprite sheets and make it easy to make them move and interact with each other

See the test app to see what the project is currently capable of doing (which so far, is not much)
